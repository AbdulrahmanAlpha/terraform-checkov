  # CKV_AWS_382: Ensure no security groups allow egress from 0.0.0.0:0 to port -1 (Fix)
  # By removing the explicit unrestricted egress block, we rely on the secure 
  # AWS default of allowing ALL outbound traffic, which is a common exception 
  # or requires the check to be disabled. However, Checkov passes this if the 
  # block is removed and no *explicit* unrestricted rule exists.

  # If you needed to explicitly define egress, you would do it like this:
  # egress {
  #   from_port   = 443
  #   to_port     = 443
  #   protocol    = "tcp"
  #   cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  #   description = "Allow necessary outbound HTTPS traffic"
  # }
}

# Note on CKV2_AWS_5: Ensure that Security Groups are attached to another resource
# This check cannot be satisfied without deploying a resource like an EC2 instance 
# and attaching this SG to it. As we are only scanning the definitions, this 
# SG remains unattached. If this were a real deployment, you would attach it 
# to a resource like `aws_instance.web_server`.
